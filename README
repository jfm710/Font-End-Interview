## Background
Welcome to the PlacePass codeing exercise. The displayed product 
is only there to show as an example and some of the css has 
been defined for you.

## Problem
Using React we would like you to create a simplified version 
of our search results page. 

Please aim to spend no more than 2-3 hours and complete as 
many of the following features as possible
  1. Have all the products in /src/api/experiences.js listed in a 
    grid 3 products wide and responsive to where it will only be 
    one product wide for a typical mobile device
  2. Add the ability to Favorite a product. 
      - After interacting with the heart the heart should look 
        visually diffrent.
      - A count of the number of favorited items should be show 
        in the  header
  3. Interacting with the Favorites link should display only
    the products that have been favorited
